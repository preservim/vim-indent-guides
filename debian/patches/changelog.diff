+
+    Bug: In vim7, 'exe pos' doesn't seem to always work. Sometimes it leads to
+         a spurious double-quote being inserted into the text. I have no idea
+         why this happens. However, using vim's native setpos() when available
+         seems to not have this problem.
+    Fix: When setpos/getpos() are available use them instead. Two new utility
+         functions Tex_(Set|Get)Pos() have been provided. Use these henceforth
+         to record/restore cursor position.
+
+    New: Expand ... to \dots also when the package ellipsis is detected.

+    Bug: When a file is included as
+         \input{file.tex}
+         then there is an error in \ref completion (Matthias Rosenkranz)
+    Why: outline.py always appends .tex to the filename so that we try to
+         include file.tex.tex which does not exist.
+    Fix: Try opening file and then file.tex and use the first one which is OK.
+         This avoids problems with having to guess. (modified version of patch
+         submitted by Franz Pletz)

+    Bug: The contents of the unnamed register get over-written while switching
+         buffers. (Andreas Lagemann)
+    Why: I assumed (wrongly) that doing "ay would not affect the unnamed
+         register. Appparently it does.
+    Fix: Also remember and restore @" in Tex_pack_updateall().

+
+    New: Support the Tex_ImageDir setting more fully. Now when Tex_ImageDir
+         is found, then pressing <F9> to complete \includegraphics will open up
+         the file-browser on the directory pointed to by Tex_ImageDir. When a
+         file is chosen, the filename is completed relative to Tex_ImageDir.

+
+    Bug: Using <S-F5> to change
+            \begin{eqnarray}
+                2 = 3 \label{first} \\
+                4 = 5
+            \end{eqnarray}
+         to an \begin{align}...\end{align} inserts \nonumber's.
+    Why: It was assumed that we will only change starred environments (i.e,
+         ones which will not be numbered) into unstarred environments.
+    Fix: Only insert \nonumber if the original environment was starred and the
+         new environment is not.
+
+         Ofcourse, its not obvious that this is the right thing to do. It feels
+         that someone would convert a previously starred environment into a
+         starred one precisely to give it a label or something similar. Why
+         increase the work required by inserting \nonumber? More feedback
+         needed. For now, I'm just fixing the obvious bug.

+
+    New: Significant speedup for the FB_DisplayFiles() function. Instead of
+         using FB_Strntok() to get the i^th line of glob('*'), iterate using
+         stridx(). This makes the time required by FB_OpenFileBrowser() to list
+         the files in C:/WINDOWS/system32 reduce from 104 seconds to 1 second.
+         If v:version >= 700, then we can directly use Vim's inbuilt list and
+         split() functions. This makes the time go to 0.6 seconds.

+
+    New: Latex-suite (once again) honors Tex_ImageDir.  This setting is
+         supposed to be the name of a _single_ directory. Its used when <F9> is
+         pressed to complete an \includegraphics command. In this situation,
+         the file browser is opened on the directory pointed to by Tex_ImageDir
+         rather than the current directory.

+         expansion of the template. Since I didn't write this part, I do not
+         really know what exactly might be wrong.
+    Fix: Make the call to Tex_updateall() _before_ the call to
+         IMAP_PutTextWithMovement(). This seems to be much better behaved.

+         2. changed the mime-type of all files to text/plain

+
+    Bug: outline.py cannot read in the contents of the main file.
+    Why: This is still unresolved. I am still very unclear about how LaTeX
+         treates \input statements. Do we always need to provide the extension
+         or is it implicitly included? This is not really "fixed". Just works

+
+    Bug: Sometimes latex-suite does not compile even it needs to redo the
+    	 references.
+    Why: We depended purely on the string "Rerun to get references right" in
+    	 the log file. Sometimes, this message is suppressed by latex although
+    	 the AUX file is outdated.
+    Fix: Compare the contents of the AUX file before and after latex is run to
+    	 see if it changed. This is more fool-proof than relying on latex's
+    	 message.

+    Why: Tex_DoCommand() never set s:isvisual.

+
+    New: A major new feature for making \ref completion easier. Instead of a
+         flat list of all the \label's which becomes almost impossible to use
+         in large projects, present the list of \label's in a tree form
+         according to the document sectioning. This makes it easier to
+         logically "zoom" into the relevant \labels without having to wade
+         through gobs and gobs of irrelevant results.
+
+         outline.py is a new python script which needs to run in order to get
+         this to work. The file should be an executable present in the same
+         path as outline.vim. Since the file was added on a windows machine,
+         its not clear how CVS will treat the permissions.
+
+    New: The filenames are now completed relative to the master tex file
+         location. This is how latex wants the filenames.

+    Fix: An important lesson learnt is that its important to avoid moving the
+         cursor in functions called by insert mode mappings except at the very
+         end. This prevents us from having to account for too many corner
+         cases.

+
+    New: Using :vimgrep if v:version >= 700.
+
+         This avoids common pitfalls with correctly setting up the 'grepprg'
+         and also avoids all the quoting and calling issues on various
+         platforms. This should hopefully reduce the frequency of the most
+         commonly occuring problem which users of vim-latex face.
+
+         Doing this also uncovered a hidden bug in Tex_ScanFileForLabels().
+         Looks like cruft was carried over when code was copied over blindly
+         from Tex_ScanFileForCite().
+
+         Also distilled the :grep'ing into Tex_Grep and Tex_Grepadd which call
+         either :grep or :vimgrep depending on the vim version. A small change
+         needed to be made to Tex_SyncPreviewWindow() to account for differing
+         cwindow looks like :grep or :vimgrep is used.

+
+    Bug: If the main file ($1 if (.*).latexmain) is opened with vim, vim
+         hangs itself up when opening other tex files in the same document.  To
+         reproduce:
+
+            $ mkdir /tmp/latexhang
+            $ cd !$
+            $ touch a.tex a.tex.latexmain b.tex

+            $ vim b.tex
+            [...]
+
+         Some times, a ctrl-c enables the editing of b.tex.
+         (Martin Krafft)
+    Why: ``screen -dm vim a.tex`` creates a .a.vim.swp file. In
+         Tex_pack_updateall(), there is a ``split a.tex`` which makes vim put
+         up the standard, "choose what to do" prompt. Unfortunately, this is
+         not seen by the user. Therefore it looks like things have hung.
+    Fix: Use ``sview a.tex`` instead of ``split a.tex``.

+
+    New: A refactoring of code to use Tex_GetVarValue instead of using g:Tex_*
+         variables. Basically, this makes it possible for the user to more
+         finely tune the behavior of latex-suite on a per-project basis.
+         As of now, most settings of latex-suite are handled by setting
+         global variables like g:Tex_UseMakeFile. In the future, we should set
+         "factory defaults" in texrc by setting g:Tex_* variables. After that,
+         we should always use Tex_GetVarValue to query the value of the
+         variable. This allows the user to over-ride the factory default at a
+         variety of levels, for example:
+         1. If the user defines g:Tex_* in ~/.vim/ftplugin/tex.vim, then he
+            will over-ride the setting for all files.
+         2. If he defines b:Tex_* in a project master file, for instance, if he
+            sets
+                let b:Tex_UseMakeFile = 0
+            in one .latexmain file, then only .tex files which source that
+            .latexmain file will not use the makefile. Other files will
+            continue to use the makefile.

+    Bug: Part compilation doesn't work because the temporary file created does
+         not include the preamble of the original main file.
+    Why: We used Tex_GetMainFileName(':p:r') from before the time
+         Tex_GetMainFileName was changed.
+    Fix: Use Tex_GetMainFileName(':p') instead.

+
+    Bug: Sometimes, even if there are errors in compiling the .tex file,
+         Tex_RunLaTeX proceeds to convert to ps, etc.
+    Why: The pattern used to check whether there is an error lin the :clist is
+         very restrictive. If there are errors which do not have an associated
+         line number, then the pattern doesn't match and we fail to detect that
+         there is an error.
+    Fix: Just use very simple patterns.

+    Bug: If an error is of the form
+         >> ! Missing $ inserted.

+         (there's a single <space> after l.9), then the line number is not
+         recognized.
+    Why: The 'efm' setting contains only '%+Cl.%l\ %m', which means that the
+         line number is recognized only when the "l.<number><space>" is
+         followed by a message.
+    Fix: Append '%+Cl.%l\ ' to the 'efm'.

+
+    Bug: when 'ignorecase' is set, then typing 'etB' triggers an error.
+    Why: With 'ignorecase' set, 'etB' matches 'ETB', therefore, LookupCharacter
+         assumes that a map exists for 'etB' and tries to find the value of
+         s:Map_Tex_etB which doesn't exist.
+    Fix: Force matching case with the \C pattern.

+    Why: hasmapto() uses "nvo" as the default. Therefore, checking for the

+
+    Bug: IEEEtran.tex template inserted needless indentation. There was also an
+         extra ``\begin{document}`` and some mismatched curly braces.
+
+    Please follow the following guidelines henceforth in creating templates:
+
+    1. The first placeholder in the template should be an empty placeholder
+       As of now, vim does not provide the equivalent of a "startinsert"
+       command for leaving in visual mode.
+
+    2. There should not be any indentation in the file. For example, if the
+       template contains a ``\begin{eqnarray}``, it should be written as::
+
+            \begin{eqnarray}
+            <+write equation here+>
+            \end{eqnarray}
+
+       instead of::
+
+            \begin{eqnarray}
+                <+write equation here+>
+            \end{eqnarray}
+
+       ``IMAP_PutTextWithMovement`` automatically inserts the correct
+       indentation according to the user's ``'sw'`` and other indent settings.
+
+    3. No trailing empty lines after the ``\end{document}``.

+Date:   Mon Dec 15 00:53:27 2003 +0000
+
+    Change: Initially, Tex_EscapeForGrep would always double backslashes at
+            least once to account for the fact that the user means the external
+            grep command to see the string ``\\label`` when he passes
+            ``\label`` to this function. But making such guesses is bad for
+            cases when we want to pass a single ``\`` to the external grep
+            command (for instance when we want to pass ``\<word\>`` to the
+            external grep command). Therefore, stop this function from making
+            any guesses about what the user might have wanted the external
+            command to see.  This function now expects the user to pass the
+            exact string which he wants the external grep command to see.

+
+    New: The fold text is now also "indented". in other words, the fold text is
+         now prepended with the whitespace of the current line so that
+         nested-ness is more apparent.

+
+    Attempting to fix the filenames with spaces problem. Also since
+    Tex_GetMainFileName() _always_ returns a file name now, (even if a
+    .latexmain file does not exist), lots of redundant logic is now removed.
+
+commit cd61de86a9e1677e4ed6847f66e1587232ca71de
+Author: Srinath Avadhanula <srinathava@gmail.com>
+Date:   Sun Dec 14 07:13:44 2003 +0000
+
+    A serious attempt at fixing the file names with spaces problems across
+    various platforms.
+
+    Change: Tex_GetMainFileName now applies the file name modifier to the
+            filename after removing the trailing .latexmain part if it exists.
+
+    Bug: Tex_FindInRtp would return a non-empty string even if a filename is
+         not found in the &rtp.
+
+    New: A trivial function Tex_CD() which just escapes spaces in the directory
+         name before cd'ing to it.
+         Use this function henceforth whenever you want to cd to another
+         directory instead of the
+            exec 'cd '.dirname
+         routine.
+
+         TODO: Maybe make this robust to detect previous attempts at escaping
+               spaces and if so, /not/ escape it again.

+Author: Srinath Avadhanula <srinathava@gmail.com>
+Date:   Tue Dec 2 11:16:04 2003 +0000
+
+    Change: By default do not fold any commands at all. This is because the
+            start pattern for a command requires a regexp which will match
+            unbalanced parentheses of arbitrary depth. Apparently it can be
+            proved that this cannot be done with regexps.
+
+            Just to be on the safe side, change the start pattern for a command
+            to '^\s*\\'.name.'{[^{}]*$'. This will at least ensure that no
+            illegal folds are created. The limitation is that some legal folds
+            might also not be created.

+
+    A kind of big rearrangement of latex-suite is in order now that a stable
+    release (1.5) has been made.
+
+    main.vim, packages.vim, templates.vim
+    Change: Tex_FindInRtp() used some pattern substitution to convert from
+            files returned by globpath to the required format. This is
+            unreliable and _very_ platform dependent. Attempting to use
+            fnamemodify() instead which takes care of such issues internally.
+            This change fixed a couple of bugs on my windows machine.
+
+    multicompile.vim, main.vim
+    Change: Functions like Tex_CatFile() etc which originally were located in
+            multicompile.vim have been moved here. The python equivalents of
+            the functions have been placed in pytools.py. multicompile.vim is
+            now effectively "empty". In the future, this file might be removed
+            from CVS. For now, I have a single "finish" in the file. This is to
+            enable a problem-free transition when this file is finally removed.
+
+    pytools.py
+    New: This file contains certain python functions to work around limitations
+         in vim scripting language. For example, there is no way in vim to read

+    New: A function Tex_GetTempName() which returns the name of a termporary
+         file in a given directory. Ideally, when compiling a fragment of a
+         file, we should create the temporary file in the same directory as the
+         original file. This function enables this to be done. The temporary
+         files thus created are removed when vim exits.

+            the prefix. I will make those changes gradually.

+
+    Fix: Tex_thebibliography did not use the Tex_UseMenuWizard setting.
+         Thus <F5> completion would always ask some questions.
+
+    Change: A little change to the Tex_InsertItem() function and the way the
+            styles for the various environments are done. In the present way,
+            we define global variables of the form:
+                g:Tex_ItemStyle_thebibliography =
+                    \ '\item[<+biblabel+>]{<+bibkey+>} '
+            This is more flexible than the old approach because this way, the
+            item style can be arbitrarily complex instead of being limited to
+            one of four styles.

+
+    Bug: Sometimes, the preview window is not properly synced.

+
+    This is big commit.
+    In main.vim new function Tex_FileInRtp. Now we can find files for
+    packages, templates and macros in all runtime directories.
+    Results are different for all types. For package files it source all of
+    them in order according to &rtp. In this way package files are treated
+    as normal Vim plugin files and behaviour for each package can be
+    modified as for ftplugin files in .vim, /usr/.../vim, and .vim/after
+    directories.
+    For templates it allows to see files in system-wide and local
+    directories. File in the local directory with the same name as in system
+    dir will overshadow system template.
+    For macros basic behaviour is the same but if someone will try to
+    TMacroEdit system-wide macro file will be copied to local version of
+    macros dir with suffix to name '-local'. Awkward but avoids situation
+    when user removes local copy of system macro and still see this macro in
+    menu (and in completion of : command).
+    If user choose to remove file latexSuite refuse to remove system file.
+
+    Completion of : commands relating for packages, templates, macros. Looks
+    in all &rtp directories.

+    Bug: If compiling latex causes an error and bibtex/makeindex is run
+         afterwards, the errors dissapear from the clist, causing us to think
+         there were no errors in the document.
+    Fix: Always re-parse the .log file after all compilers have been called to
+         ensure that we will always be able to find problems with the latex
+         compilation.

+
+    - Refactored code to only have one copy of the main function
+      Tex_CompileMultipleTimes() instead of maintaining a duplicate. Just
+      duplicate the helper functions.
+
+    - Also removed a bug in the original version where a change in the index
+      terms was not causing latex to be rerun.

+    Bug: When latex-suite is packaged as a system wide utility installed in
+         /usr/share/vim/vim61, then the local texrc file in
+         ~/.vim/ftplugin/tex/texrc does not get sourced as claimed in the
+         documentation. (Chris Greenwood)
+    Why: latex-suite tries to source ../tex/texrc from where main.vim resides,
+         which in the case of system wide installations is not
+         ~/.vim/ftplugin/tex/texrc
+    Fix: Just use :runtimepath instead of using s:up_path etc.

+           like c:/cygwin, so it looks for the file in the wrong place.
+    Fix: Always lcd to the current directory of the bib file being searched.
+         This avoids any path issues.

+    Bug: If we used :TTarget ps, then the compiler would be called as:

+         instead of
+            dvips -o file.ps file.dvi
+    Why: In a recent change, we made RunLaTeX() use filenames with extension.
+         However, some compilation rules might require filenames w/o extensions
+         (such as Tex_CompileRule_ps which is 'dvips -o $*.ps $*.dvi')
+    Fix: Try to guess if the &makeprg requires files w/o extensions by seeing
+         if it matches '\$\*\.\w\+'. If so, use file-name w/o extension.
+         Otherwise, retain extension in 'make '.fname

+    Bug: Pressing <F9> at the end of a line like
+         This is a \ref{eqn:something} and this is a comp
+         would cause errors.
+    Why: The substitute() command returns the original string if the pattern

+    Fix: Therefore first check if there is a match.
+
+    Bug: Once we complete an equation, we can never complete a word.
+    Why: s:type is never unlet
+    Fix: unlet! s:type if there is no match on current line to any known

+
+    Bug: Pressing <CR> during word completion does not take us to the location
+         of the match, as claimed.
+    Why: <CR> does "cc <num> | pclose! | cclose!". Because the preview window
+         with the match is open, therefore cc will take us to the match in
+         the preview window, after which pclose closes it up!
+    Fix: Do 'pclose! cc <num> | cclose' instead...

+    New: Bibliography searching was pretty delicate before where only a few

+         robust using :find. This has the advantage of letting us use vim's
+         native file-searching capability to find out bibliography file etc.
+    New: Capability to retain the \cite search in memory so we do not have to
+         make searches with every <F9> pressed. This is useful because quite
+         often the bibliography is a _huge_ file which is not changed very
+         seldom and we might want add a lot of \cite's between changes to the
+         bibliography file.

+
+    Change: Instead of using very complicated logic to find out the locations
+            of package files, just use vim's native :find command. This easily
+            avoids problems of not being able to search more than 1 level deep
+            etc. Ofcourse, this means that the users have to specify
+            g:Tex_TEXINPUTS in the format given in :help file-searching, but
+            that seems a very acceptable thing to do.
+            Why was globpath() and all that used previously?

+
+    Bug: <F5> does not work if we type in the name of a package latex-suite
+         doesn't recognize. a 0 is inserted.
+    Cause: In the recent feature where Tex_PutEnvironment also tried to scan
+           environments added by packages, there is no fail-safe at the end of
+           all the if statements.
+    Solution: if all else fails remember to at least insert a bare-bones
+              environment.

+
+    Bug: When a \usepackage{} line is inside a fold, then we go into an
+         infinite loop. (Lin-bo Zhang)
+    Cause: Due to an apparent vim bug, when if we issue the command
+           /somepattern
+           in a closed fold, then we always goto the first match in the fold.
+    Solution: A temporary hack of first opening up all folds before scanning
+              and then closing them. This needs to be robustified in the future
+              using mkview.vim

+
+    Bug: Sometimes Tex_FindBblFiles() would return a bunch of files with
+         new-lines in them.
+    Cause: substitue(text, '\n', ' ', 'ge')
+           doesn't remove newlines (at least in vanilla vim 6.1).
+    Solution: Use substitute(text, "\n", ' ', 'ge')
+              instead. NOTE: use double quotes when using special characters in
+              replacement string in substitute().
+
+    Bug: Sometimes the latex file would get the maps from Tex_c_window_setup().
+    Cause: The maps would be created even when s:UpdateViewerWindow() closed
+           off the quickfix and preview window because of error E32 and focus
+           returned to the latex window.
+    Solution: Check if &ft == 'qf' before setting maps.
+
+    Bug: If the tex file used a '\bibliography' command to include a .bib file,
+         it would not be found. (on windows)
+    Cause: Used ':' as a path seperator. which crashes on windows, because a
+           path is of the form c:/path/to/something (i.e ':' is a character in
+           every path!!)
+    Solution: Use "\n" as a path seperator on windows.
+              TODO: Should we be using "\n" for other OSs too?

+
+    This script provides a command :RemoteOpen which is supposed to be used
+    from the command line as follows:
+
+    gvim -c ":RemoteOpen +<lnum> <filename>"
+
+    where <lnum> is the line-number you wish <filename> to open to.  What will
+    happen is that a new gvim will start up and enquire from all previous
+    sessions if <filename> is already open in any of them. If it is, then it
+    will edit the file in that session and bring it to the foreground and itself
+    quit. Otherwise, it will not quit and instead open up the file for editing
+    at <lnum>.
+
+    This was mainly created to be used with Yap (the dvi previewer in miktex),
+    so you can specify the program for "inverse search" as specified above.
+    This ensures that the inverse search uses the correct gvim each time.

+         because the regexp thought that s:type = '\columnwidth]'
+         Improved the regexp to account for commands within options. Still not
+         tested extensively, but should be better than before.
+
+    Bug: "wincmd q" does not always seem to work from within the script (this
+        is a vim bug). replace with q which seems more reliable.

+
+    Bug: <F9> for inserting references does not work in standard vim + cygwin
+         combination for windows.
+    Cause: Vim issues commands via the vimrun.exe program which calls the
+        cygwin bash shell in the following manner:
+            bash -c "command"
+        when we do ":!command" from within vim. With the current setup we issue
+        the command
+            !fgrep "\\label{" *.tex > c:/TEMP/VIe12.tmp
+        This gets converted into
+            bash -c "fgrep "\\label{" *.tex > c:/TEMP/VIe12.tmp"
+        by vimrun.exe. This causes all sorts of confusion.
+    Solution: Avoid issuing commands which contain double quotes otherwise
+        vimrun.exe screws up. Convert the grep commands to
+            grep '\label{' *.tex
+        from
+            grep "\\label{" *.tex
+        NOTE: the backslash escaping still needs to be done due to the outer
+        double quotes in the exec statement.

+    Bug:
+    Srinath: but your patch makes impossible to distinguish between various
+    	extenstions of LaTeX files - .tex, .ltx and so on
+
+    Solution: use not :r files for compiling but remove extension when
+    	dealing with quickfix window
+
+    But with both versions I have serious bug: when walking with j, k and
+    <cr> through list of errors I am getting message:
+
+    PositionPreviewWindow:

+
+    Bug: the preview window with the .log window was not being opened on
+         compilation error.
+    Cause: We used to depend on the file's suffix being removed for a lot of
+           processing. A recent change seems to have reversed this.

+    This is almost standard version of explorer plugin. This addition to lS
+    is necessary for things like explorer-completion.
+
+    Change is to make EditEntry function global available. It makes possible
+    to remap standard explorer shortcuts for better interaction with lS.
+    I signalized this on vim@vim.org and hope it will be standard behaviour
+    of explorer.vim in next Vim editions thus we won't need this file. But
+    for today pros are much more than contras I think.

+
+    Bug: iabs break when latex-suite is triggered.
+         (Preben Randhol, Sanip P Deshmukh)
+    Cause: If a mapping ends in a letter (say '\'), then abbreviations are not
+        triggered by that letter. For example, if we have
+            imap \ <C-r>='\'<CR>
+            iab 12 twelve
+        Then typing 12\ doesn't expand to twelve\.
+        (Strangely enough "imap \ ?" doesn't have this problem and we get
+        twelve?. Vim bug?)
+        This problem is aggravated by the fact that latex-suite "protects"
+        most letters to avoid expansions such as ``2 -> `\sqrt{}
+    Solution: After checking for mappings ending in a letter, if that letter is
+        not in 'iskeyword', then also check whether the previous word has
+        an abbreviation. Since vim does not have the equivalent of
+        mapcheck() for abbreviations, this is complicated (maybe even hacky).

+           Imap_PlaceHolderEnd. (Sumit Bhardwaj)
+      Solution: Temporarily set &selection = exclusive in IMAP_Jumpfunc().

+
+    - a tentative attempt to make including the graphicx package change the
+      behavior of EFI from \psfig to \includegraphics. Note that this is far
+      from ideal. For example, as of now, once the user opens a file with
+      \usepackage{graphicx}, then EFI will begin using \includegraphics even if
+      he switches back to a file without \usepackage{graphicx}.
+
+      Doing that will require extensive changes to the envmacros.vim file, I
+      think... (I haven't thought about it enough to find out if a simpler
+      workaround is possible).

+      every file through it would be source'd only once for every buffer. This
+      means that if a file needs to be called every time a filetype event
+      occurs (not just the first time), it wasn't possible. This limitation was
+      making adding a feature such as updating the packages menu when we switch
+      buffers very ugly to implement.
+
+      Adopt a much more elegant apprach. Throw a LatexSuiteFileType event every
+      time tex_latexSuite is sourced... This enables each component of
+      latex-suite to function independently without having to depend of
+      main.vim in the heavy manner they did previously. Components which need
+      to be sourced only once will ignore this event. Components which need to
+      set buffer local maps will catch this event and set the maps with some
+      reinclusion avoiding logic... and so on and so forth...
+      See the next few commits of main.vim, compiler.vim etc for details.

+    - instead of custom functions for creating prompt strings of

+      TODO: There are many globally visible functions not starting with the
+            Tex_ prefix. Will have to fix that soon.
+
+    - Code cleanup: bugs where introduced in previous versions when

+      Mikolaj to be a bit more careful in adding new features...
+
+    - More cleanup: Also changed some script local variables to function local
+      variables...  Should ask Mikolaj not to use script local variables
+      unecessarily.  They make the code very unreadable. I always keep
+      wondering why this variable needs to be visible outside this function...
+

+    - New file: newlatex-suite.txt
+      This is a temporary file for reworking the documentation. I noticed that
+      the original documentation read too much like a story... In particular,
+      the table of contents was too wordy and the user didn't get a nice
+      overview at a glance. This is an attempt to rework mainly the TOC and
+      maybe some of the sections too...
+      In particular:
+      - add sections for how to customize. A section containing all the
+        available options.
+      - a section containing all available <Plug>'d maps and again how to
+        override the default maps.
+      - add documentation for bibtex.vim, which provides nice support for
+        editing .bbl files. (Alan G Isaac promised some docs for this long ago,
+        but hasn't yet given any).
+
+    Once we get this file incorporated into the main latex-suite.txt, I will
+    push this into the attic. I could have started a new branch for this, but
+    it felt like too much work...

+    - Charles Boncelet suggested `M -> \sum_{}^{}.
+    - In order to guard against expanding to \sum.. on typing M at the start of
+      a quotation, create a fake map
+        call IMAP('``M', '``M', 'tex')
+      Since IMAP() always uses the longest lhs ending in a character, this fake
+      map elegantly solves the problem. Use this strategy to "protect" greek
+      letter mappings as well. So now we do not need a special
+      s:TEX_InsertGreekLetter() function... Just create fake maps like
+      ``a -> ``a and \`a -> \`a.

+    - Description of arguments to IMAP_Jumpfunc().
+    - IMAP_Jumpfunc() is now able to handle <+placeholders
+      withlinebreaks+>
+    - Bug: If we were selecting in the backward direction, and we want to move
+           backwards, then 2 <Plug>IMAP_JumpBack's are needed. i.e, if we have
+    	   <+1+> <+2+> <+3+>
+    	   and we do (with <C-k> mapped to <Plug>IMAP_JumpBack)
+    	   <C-j><C-j><C-k>, from before <+1+>, then we remain in <+2+>.
+    	   (Bug pointed out by LH)
+      Cause: In visual mode, <Plug>IMAP_JumpBack deselects the text but remains
+             at the end of the selection. (this is default vim behavior).
+    		 Therefore searching back for the placeholder start character lands
+    		 us up in the template.
+      Solution: In visual mode, make <Plug>IMAP_JumpBack goto `< after
+                deselecting text. This strategy also leads to considerable
+    			simplification at other places.

+
+    * Improve s:PutTextWithMovement() by using a new helper function, IMAP_Mark(),
+    to position the cursor instead of adding a marker string and searching for it.
+    The marker would cause serious trouble if it occurred anywhere in the inserted
+    text, and minor trouble if it was too long and caused an unwanted line break.
+
+    * Fix a bug (mea culpa) in s:LookupCharacter() and IMAP_list().  If there was
+    a global map for "foo" and a local (filetype) map for "bozo" then these
+    functions would look at the last character, "o", see that there were local
+    maps ending in "o", and only look for local maps.

+
+        One little improvement in TexFormatLine.  First, my treatment of \$
+        isn't working, so I deleted it.  But I was able to take care of the
+        following.  Sometimes people write $$...$$ in a single line, so the
+        function should be able to tell that you are within a math expression.
+
+        Also, I didn't think that your command for clearing memory deserved its
+        own variable, so I just put an extra line in the function.
+
+        For the moment, I don't know what to do about \$

+      As of now, both of these have hardcoded srinathava@vim-latex. If someone

+      The release: target is meant to take care of the annoying problem where

+    - removing the time stamp string. It is causing problems in merging from

+    - Bug: Pressing a <space> before the second $ of a line like:
+           $aaaaa........$
+    	   caused spurious newlines to be inserted after the current line.
+      Cause: Carl knows.
+      Solution: [Cut/paste from Carl Mueller's email about this]
+
+    	  I do have an answer for the problem of typing the space before the
+    	  "$" in $aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa...$.  But it does involve making
+    	  TexFormatLine dependent on 2 new variables, current_line and
+    	  current_column, which record the line (as a string) and the column
+    	  number.  With that change, it's easy to modify the "if" statement at
+    	  the end of the function.  I also have to modify the function TexFill,
+    	  to define and pass on the new variables.

+    Bug: More debugging the debug functions! Ahh... The irony. The

+    Cause/Solution: used a:pattern instead of pattern
+

+    Solution: Used the Tex_SetFastEnvironmentMaps() from envmacros.vim in order

+              every tex file opened.

+

+    Cause: -- ditto --
+    Solution: Provide <plug>ed mappings in here and a function
+              Tex_SetFastEnvironmentMaps(). This function is called from
+              main.vim for every buffer. Thus buffer local maps are made for

+
+    Another great bug report from Ulrich Spoerlein.
+    Bug: When the following .tex file is opened with latex-suite, we get a
+         choose package prompt:
+    -----------------------------%<-----------------------------
+    \documentclass{report}
+    \usepackage[a4paper, pdftex, dvips, ps2pdf,
+    		bookmarks, bookmarksopen, bookmarksnumbered,
+    		colorlinks, linkcolor=blue, urlcolor=blue]{hyperref}
+    \usepackage{cite}
+    \begin{document}
+    \end{document}
+    -----------------------------%<-----------------------------
+    Cause: the original algorithm for finding packages failed when the
+           \usepackage definition was split across lines as shown here.
+    Solution: Rewrite the Tex_pack_all function to act much more robustly.
+              This method is able to account for multiple line definitions
+              pretty well.
+              Just to be on the safe side, ensure that Tex_pack_one is never
+              called with '' which causes the prompt.

+
+    Made the debugging statements more advanced. Each file can now call
+    Tex_Debug as
+        call Tex_Debug('something', 'modulename')
+    Afterwards, we can do:
+        call Tex_PrintDebug('modulename')
+    This way debugging statements from various modules will not interfere with
+    each other.
+
+    These functions might seem like bloat, but the reason I am making them is
+    that in the future when latex-suite becomes even bigger, it might be
+    painful to find out why a user is facing problems. In such cases, we might
+    want to tell the user to do something like, "Set g:Tex_Debug = 1, do `lv
+    and then please tell us what g:Tex_PrintDebug('compiler') says" (if for
+    instance the user has some compilation/viewing problems).

+         ^
+         line starts here. There is a space before the leading $

+    Fix: Instead of trying to see if the first character of the line is '$',
+         check if the first non blank character is a '$'. This seems a little
+         like a temporary fix though..

+
+    1. Problem: When the user tries to trigger an abbreviation near the eol,
+       the marker string being too long triggers a line break.
+       Therefore, just for the time being check to see if phs != phe, and if
+       so, then use phs.phs as the marker (improbable string).
+       We would like ultimately to completeley get over this hack and use
+       movement instead.
+
+    2. Problem: The <C-K> map for jumping back was interfering with the
+       dictionary completion mode of vim. Therefore change default mapping for
+       jumping back to <S-C-J> instead of <C-K>. Ofcourse this makes it
+       invisible to non-gui users (I think).
+
+    3. Tried to do the "right" thing for mapping. First provide a number of
+       mappings using <plug>. These mappings call IMAP_Jumpfunc() in various
+       ways. Various <plug> mappings for various modes have been provided.
+       After this, we map the default keys to the <plug> mappings checking for
+       hasmapto() each time. This provides for a robust and easy user
+       customization. Initially, the user had to do something like:
+            inoremap <C-J> <C-r>=IMAP_Jumpfunc('', 0)<CR>
+       in his .vimrc to be able to override our mapping. Now he will do
+            inoremap <C-J> <Plug>IMAP_JumpForward
+       Doing this also has the advantage that changes in IMAP_Jumpfunc() will
+       not affect the user customization.
+       NOTE: This <plug> things were inspired by looking at the excellent
+       cvscommand.vim plugin I've begun using...

+           IMAP_PutTextWithMovement() to mark the beginning of the left-hand side
+           contains spaces! This causes expansions near the end of a line to
+           trigger line breaks (if 'fo' contains t, which is default and tw != 0),
+           so that the marker text is broken across lines...  Havoc ensues.

+    Disabling diacritics by default. It looks like most people who need
+    accented characters are able to type them directly, and for those who
+    can't, these maps only save one keystroke, while causing a _lot_ of
+    headaches for people who do not use diacritics.

+
+    Bug: The mappings in latex-suite effect only the first .tex file being
+         edited.
+    Cause: In a recent chage, when IMAP(lhs, rhs, ft) is called with a
+           a:ft != '', then it sets the mapping to be buffer local.  This
+           breaks latex-suite which calls the IMAP() functions only once when
+           it is first started, not for every buffer. Changing things so that
+           the mappings are called with every filetype event will be
+           1. quite time consuming
+           2. kind of inefficient in that a _lot_ of lines will need to be
+              resourced with every filetype event.
+
+    So until a better solution presents itself, make all maps created by
+    IMAP() global (not buffer-local).

+    Problem: The original mechanism did not account for the placeholder settings
+      being changed.
+    Changed the templates such that the first line contains a tab delimited
+    list of placeholder specifications used in the file as well as the special
+    characters for computing and executing things within the templates.
+
+    ReadTemplate() reads in these specs from the first line and
+    ProcessTemplates() uses them to process the template file. This allows for
+    the template maker to not have to bother with the users placeholder
+    settings.

+
+    This is a merge from the b-newimaps branch. The branch was started when a
+    need to robustify imaps.vim was felt. Before, it had a big dependence on
+    "funky" characters. Since imaps.vim affected a lot of files, this commit
+    has a lot of modified files.
+
+    Briefly, it changes the <<, >> and the <a-umlaut> characters throughout
+    latex-suite to 'unfunky' characters.
+    << --- <+
+    >> --- +>
+    <a-umlaut> --- <++>
+
+    The syntax of IMAP and IMAP_PutTextWithMovement was also changed to accept
+    2 new optional arguments which specify the placeholder characters in the
+    a:rhs. This allows scriptwriters to generate long term maps which will not
+    depend on the internals of imaps.vim
+
+    The b-newimaps tip at the time of this merge has been tagged as
+    b-newimaps-merge-sa-1

+
+    Example:
+    In order to use some other key, (say <CTRL-c>) to use Tex_MathCal(), do the

+
+    	inoremap <buffer> <silent> <C-c> <C-r>=Tex_MathCal()<CR>
+

+
+    This will never trigger the map.

+    Changing encoding from one locale to the next causes huge ugly screen
+    flickers. Therefore only change encoding if the original encoding is not
+    latin1. This will at least cause it to be smoother on machines using latin1
+    encoding.
+
+    The problem ofcourse will still be there for other locales. Therefore, look

+
+    If only someone had told me at the beginning not to use ascii > 127

+    This is not possible to make different prompt than "Enter

+
+    A very difficult fix for the encoding problem...
+
+    Bug: When 'encoding' is set to utf8, then macros dont work. i.e, typing
+    	() results in (�)�� with the cursor placed at the end.
+    Cause: The behavior of vim changes according to the current encoding.
+    Solution:
+    	1. When latex-suite is first called, temporarily set encoding to
+    	   latin1, source all the files and then reset it to the original
+    	   value. This ensures that the scripts rely on a consistent encoding
+    	   scheme.
+    	2. Whenever we do encoding specific stuff, then switch back to latin1,
+    	   do our stuff and then switch back.
+
+    	This is complicated by the fact that while inserting text (using the
+    	Imap_PutText...() function), we need to insert the placeholders in the
+    	curret locale, not latin1, otherwise the user will see things like <ab>
+    	and <bb> instead of � and �. Therefore, the jump function needs to
+    	account for the fact that the characters are no longer in latin1...
+
+    TODO: Document these changes asap otherwise I will completeley forget why I
+          did what I did...

+
+    A number of bug fixes and code cleanup after the last hack job. Some
+    important changes:
+
+    1. Sometimes searching in the quickfix window for other lines before
+       current line containing an error on the same line would go into an
+       infinite loop.
+
+    2. Sometimes, when the error occurs towards the end of a long line, we get
+       something like this:
+       		l.10 ... and then there is a mistake.
+       In this case, do not use the length of the broken line but use a search
+       strategy.
+       TODO: Use a search strategy even when error line is not of the above
+       form.
+
+    3. set nowrap in quickfix window otherwise calculation width of the
+       quickfix window is faulty.

+
+    Implemented Carl's idea of having the log file also being shown when
+    RunLaTeX() is run. This is what happens presently:
+
+    When you press \ll, then the quickfix window with one error on each line
+    opens up. Beneath the quickfix window, the log file is opened in a
+    "preview" window. The display within the preview window is adjusted to
+    match with the error currently being examined by the user. When the user
+    moves around within the quickfix window, this display is automatically
+    adjusted to keep in sync.
+
+    When the user presses <enter> in the quickfix window, then he is taken to
+    the correct line and column number of the .tex file. The column number is
+    computed either from the length of the broken line after l.\d\+ in the log
+    file or if we have a undefined citation, then search for the missing
+    citation word...
+
+    New functions added:
+
+    PositionPreviewWindow() : positions the display of the log file
+    UpdatePreviewWindow() : positions the display of the log file and then
+                            returns to the quickfix window.
+    GotoErrorLocation() : goes to the correct line and column number of the
+                          .tex file being edited.
+
+    TODO:
+    1. multiple errors on the same line dont work. the preview window gets
+       stuck on the first error.
+    2. test more robustly.
+    3. Ask people about various formats of LaTeX warnings, so we can guess
+       column numbers in other situations too. As of now, only undefined
+       citations and errors are caught well. For all other kinds, we goto the
+       first column of the correct line number.

+
+    Various polymorphic macros from Carl Mueller (auctex.vim)
+    . <M-b> encloses the previous character in \mathbf{}
+    . <M-c> is polymorphic as follows:
+        Insert mode:
+        1. If the previous character is a letter or number, then capitalize it and
+           enclose it in \mathcal{}
+        2. otherwise insert \cite{}
+        Visual Mode:
+        1. Enclose selection in \mathcal{}
+    . <M-l> is also polymorphic as follows:
+        If the character before typing <M-l> is one of '([{|<q', then do the
+        following:
+          1. (<M-l>       \left(\right
+                  similarly for [, |
+             {<M-l>       \left\{\right\}
+          2. <<M-l>       \langle\rangle
+          3. q<M-l>       \lefteqn{}
+        otherwise insert  \label{}
+
+    These functions make it extremeley easy to do all the \left \right stuff in
+    latex.
+
+    Thanks to Carl Mueller for these.

+    history.  I commented out a line, and added a comment, in case this
+    depends on version and patch number of vim; I think this should work
+    with vim any vim 6.0+.  Please test.  If this change is correct, it
+    should be possible to simplify the code a bit.

+    . Syntax Error!!!! I commited a syntax error! Vim's line continuation \
+      occurs at the beginning of the second line, not the end of the first
+      line!
+
+      Hmm... This calls for a strict regimentation. Since I do not use unix so
+      often, I will never again touch code in "if !has('win32')" blocks.
+      However, installing latex with cygwin provides a very nice unix emulation
+      of vim... so debugging those things is possible.
+
+      Note to self: If you are touching "if !has('win32')" blocks, then verify
+      on cygwin/latex before commiting!

+    compiler.vim and texrc:  1. I added some support for Mac OSX, using

+    2. Instead of "--interaction=nonstopmode" I use "\nonstopmode \input{$*}"
+    as in compiler/tex.vim .  Not all versions of tex support the --interaction option, so this is more robust.  Then, the "\" and "{}" have to be escaped for

+
+    I added targets to the makefile:  install, stallin (reverse install, for
+    lack of a better name), and sync.  These require rsync to be installed
+    (but use it only locally, like cp with lots of options).  The idea is that
+    after a "cvs update" you can "make install" to put the files in your
+    ~/.vim directory (or another directory, using "make install VIMFILES=...").
+    Then, you can edit and test the files, run "make stallin", and "cvs commit".
+    If you have some changes in your local CVS directory and some in your
+    vimfiles directory, you can use "make sync".

+    . use visualmode() in VEnclose to decide linewise or characterwise
+      selection.
+    . repaired removal of \n from EOL in character-wise selection.
+      ( originally, the \n substitution was kinda useless ).
+    . in ExecMap(), use <plug>�SelectRegion� to select the region. this is
+      mapped (script locally) to `<v`>. this method avoids the problem of some
+      of the characters in the string '`<v`>' being mapped by user.
+      (as is the case with us where ` is used to start the visual mode mappings
+      for fonts!)
+    . some code beautification.
